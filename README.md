# GITFileMonitor

Be aware that this tool can contain errors as it is pretty limited in the current development state. This is a little Java tool which is monitoring files which are within local GIT. 

# How-To

You can add files which are within a GIT repository. (You have to clone the repository with another software). After adding the file and sending the tool via File => System Tray to the System Tray, a Timer will check all 30 Minutes if there was an update. (Currently you have to do a pull request yourself.)
